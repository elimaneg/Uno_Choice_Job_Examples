1. Copy the <USE_CASE01_UNOCHOICE> folder in the Jenkins <jobs> folder
2. Copy the contents of the <userContent> folder in the JENKINS_HOME\userContent folder
3. Install the uno-choice jenkins plugin
4. <Reload> the Jenkins configuration to load the new <USE_CASE01_UNOCHOICE> project
5. Build the project with parameters

You should see two choice controls and four uno-choice controls. 

The four uno-choice controls should display four different set of choices simulating the 2x2 combinations of the two choice controls. Once cascading updates have been implemented for the uno-choice control we should be able to have a single uno-choice control generating all of the four choice options with combinations of the PARAM01_METADATA and PARAM02_TYPE build parameters.
